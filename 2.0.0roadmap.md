# The Road to Living Skyrim 2.0.0
This list is subject to change at any point.

## Guaranteed 
### Stability Above All
The #1 most important goal for LS2 is to provide a solid, unerringly stable list that can be played for 50, 100, 400 hours safely without worrying about save bloat, crashes, and infinite loading screens. Everything will be done with this in mind. This isn't a guarantee that the list won't crash or have bugs, but everything in my power will be done to make it as close as possible to perfect. Mods that cause issues will be unapologetically removed.

### Method Patched
The entirety of 2.0.0 will be [method patched](https://gist.github.com/CovenantTurtle/9992289653e91455a06753ef6275590a) with the intent to remove one of either Bash or Smash patches. This will also ensure consistency and balance carries through across the board.

### More Everything
More quests, more followers, more lands, and in general *more* is on my list. I would like to include things like Wyrmstooth, Project AHO, Moon and Star, Populated Solstheim, and dungeon expansions such as Vominheim in the list.

#### Weapons & Armors Overhaul
LS2 will feature a collection of hand-picked weapons and armors. Very few if any pre-existing collections will be included. Yes, this does mean that Immersive Armors and Immersive Weapons is going away.

### Graphics Overhaul (95% complete)
2.0.0 will have an entirely new graphics suite. Some mods might get carried over, but the intent is to make LS truly stunning to look at. This likely means it will eat computers for breakfast and still be hungry afterwards. 6GB VRAM is going to be a minimum requirement, with 8GB+ recommended.

### The Economy
To say LS's economy is balanced is a bit of a joke at the moment. I would very much like to spend some serious time overhauling the economy of LS so it is more dynamic and interesting. Things like Faction Economy Complete, Supply and Demand, SkyRem Eve will help with this but will likely need to be patched together to make sure it doesn't go insane.

### Magic Rebalancing
It's no secret that magic in Living Skyrim is extremely strong. I would like to take a closer look at the magic suite included and trim it down a bit to help prevent mages from being overpowered.

### Campfire & Immersive Needs
This one has been on my list to add for a long time and with LS2, it's finally happening. Immersive Needs is related, but is being included to replace iNeed. I've found iNeed to be too intrusive in the way it affects things.

### The Civil War
Living Skyrim barely touches the Civil War in Skyrim, so it plays out in a mostly vanilla fashion. This is an issue that will be rectified with LS2.

## Very Likely
### Player Homes
I've been asked occasionally about more player homes for LS. I don't see any harm in this, so I'll be investigating a few more tastefully chosen player homes for you to purchase and inhabit.

### Music/Audio
I've recently looked into some exciting new options for audio and such for LS2. This includes new music tracks and new ambience and sound effects. Expect there to be more variety for music with LS2. Also, I am looking into including the Unofficial HD Audio Project for you audiophiles out there.

### Towns and Cities (Complete)
I love JK's Skyrim and will be keeping it, however, I feel that the various towns (Ivarstead, Rorikstead, etc.) need a bit more to bring them up to JK's level. I'll be investigating possible replacements for the Arthmoor town expansions.

## Maybe
### iEquip and QuickLoot
The hope is that both of these mods will be updated by the time 2.0.0 is ready so I can include them. I wanted them for 1.0.0 but they hadn't updated in time for 1.0.0's release.

### To SkyRem, or not to SkyRem?
The SkyRem collection of overhauls (Grace and Emily) is on my radar as a possible inclusion for 2.0.0. I haven't made up my mind if these are going to be included or not yet.

### The Crafting Overhauls
Things like CCOR and CACO have been requested to be added to the list. These are on my radar but are a huge pain to incorporate into a large lists. I am undecided if these will make the cut, but we will see. A smithing overhaul such as The Art of Smithing may also be included in this.

### EnaiRim Begone?
Enai Siaion is one of the great mod authors of our time, and the impact of his mods cannot be overstated. They are excellent in 99.9% of cases. However, there are some interesting alternatives that I am considering exploring for LS2. To name one off the top of my head, World's Dawn seems like a really cool alternative to Summermyst.

## Unlikely
### Bruma
Bruma is an enormous new land mod that has been met with almost universal acclaim. I acknowledge, it is an excellent mod, but it may be too big of an ask for it to be included.

## Not Changing
### Master of Disguise
I feel the need to address this mod specifically. It's been a headache for me dealing with questions about the mod almost constantly, but Master of Disguise is basically the only thing that does what it does. Master of Disguise will be sticking around.

### Sustained Magic
This is another mod that I've had to answer a ton of questions about, but the simple fact is this: If you haven't played using Sustained Magic, you'll never want to go back afterwards. I have hand-patched this mod to work with LS (including a few hours in CK fixing it) and it will be staying.

### UI Changes
I am very happy with the state of the LS HUD and UI. The main menu is included in this. It will be staying. The only thing I might look into is possibly changing the UI font.

### The MCMs
The MCMs will be automated as much as I can, but expect the amount of time you spend in these menus to increase. More mods = more MCMs. Sorry.

### Combat Gameplay Overhaul, Nemesis, and Combat in General
I have to be 100% honest here: I don't see a point to switch to Nemesis. Yet. If Nemesis gets some features that FNIS does not have, then I'll look into it further. To this end, Combat Gameplay Overhaul will not be in LS2. Stop asking. Please.

Combat I expect to stay roughly the same. I don't really want to change the combat mechanics.

### CBBE & BodySlide
I like CBBE and it will be staying.

### Character/NPC Visuals
Aside from a few more options regarding scars and tattoos, I do not expect this to change. NPCs will look more or less the same as they do currently.

### Everything Else
Everything not explicitly mentioned in this document is unlikely to change, but anything is possible. I'll be working closely with my team to discuss mods and this could change at any moment.
