# The Road to Living Skyrim 2.0.0
This list is subject to change at any point.

## Guaranteed 
### Stability Above All
The #1 most important goal for LS2 is to provide a solid, unerringly stable list that can be played for 50, 100, 400 hours safely without worrying about save bloat, crashes, and infinite loading screens. Everything will be done with this in mind. This isn't a guarantee that the list won't crash or have bugs, but everything in my power will be done to make it as close as possible to perfect. Mods that cause issues will be unapologetically removed.

### Method Patched (complete, pending revision)
The entirety of 2.0.0 will be [method patched](https://gist.github.com/CovenantTurtle/9992289653e91455a06753ef6275590a) with the intent to remove one of either Bash or Smash patches. This will also ensure consistency and balance carries through across the board.

### More Everything (complete, pending revision)
More quests, more followers, more lands, and in general *more* is on my list. I would like to include things like Wyrmstooth, Project AHO, Moon and Star, Populated Solstheim, and dungeon expansions such as Vominheim in the list.

#### Weapons & Armors Overhaul (complete, pending revision)
LS2 will feature a collection of hand-picked weapons and armors. Very few if any pre-existing collections will be included. Yes, this does mean that Immersive Armors and Immersive Weapons is going away.

### Graphics Overhaul (complete, pending revision)
2.0.0 will have an entirely new graphics suite. Some mods might get carried over, but the intent is to make LS truly stunning to look at. This likely means it will eat computers for breakfast and still be hungry afterwards. 6GB VRAM is going to be a minimum requirement, with 8GB+ recommended.

### The Economy (complete, pending revision)
To say LS's economy is balanced is a bit of a joke at the moment. I would very much like to spend some serious time overhauling the economy of LS so it is more dynamic and interesting. Things like  Supply and Demand, SkyRem Eve will help with this but will likely need to be patched together to make sure it doesn't go insane.

### Magic Rebalancing (complete, pending revision)
It's no secret that magic in Living Skyrim is extremely strong. I would like to take a closer look at the magic suite included and trim it down a bit to help prevent mages from being overpowered.

### Campfire & Vitality Mode (complete, pending revision)
This one has been on my list to add for a long time and with LS2, it's finally happening. Vitality Mode is related, but is being included to replace Immersive Needs. I've found iNeed to be too intrusive in the way it affects things and Immersive Needs feels like a partially finished mod.

### The Civil War (complete, pending revision)
Living Skyrim barely touches the Civil War in Skyrim, so it plays out in a mostly vanilla fashion. This is an issue that will be rectified with LS2.

## Very Likely
### Player Homes (complete, pending revision)
I've been asked occasionally about more player homes for LS. I don't see any harm in this, so I'll be investigating a few more tastefully chosen player homes for you to purchase and inhabit.

### Music/Audio (complete, pending revision)
I've recently looked into some exciting new options for audio and such for LS2. This includes new music tracks and new ambience and sound effects. Expect there to be more variety for music with LS2. Also, I am looking into including the Unofficial HD Audio Project for you audiophiles out there.

### Towns and Cities (complete, pending revision)
I love JK's Skyrim and will be keeping it, however, I feel that the various towns (Ivarstead, Rorikstead, etc.) need a bit more to bring them up to JK's level. I'll be investigating possible replacements for the Arthmoor town expansions.

## Maybe
### iEquip and QuickLoot (complete)
The hope is that both of these mods will be updated by the time 2.0.0 is ready so I can include them. I wanted them for 1.0.0 but they hadn't updated in time for 1.0.0's release. Both iEquip and QuickLoot have been updated and will be included in the Beta.

### To SkyRem, or not to SkyRem? (Partially Implemented)
Grace, Eve, Mia, and Inez are being used.

### The Crafting Overhauls (Rejected)
~~Things like CCOR and CACO have been requested to be added to the list. These are on my radar but are a huge pain to incorporate into a large lists. I am undecided if these will make the cut, but we will see. A smithing overhaul such as The Art of Smithing may also be included in this.~~ These mods are not worth the time it takes to implement them into the list.

### EnaiRim Begone? (Partially Rejected)
~~Enai Siaion is one of the great mod authors of our time, and the impact of his mods cannot be overstated. They are excellent in 99.9% of cases. However, there are some interesting alternatives that I am considering exploring for LS2. To name one off the top of my head, World's Dawn seems like a really cool alternative to Summermyst.~~ EnaiRim will, for the most part, be staying. Imperious is being replaced by SkyRem Rae, Andromeda is being replaced by Glory's Scaling Standing Stones.

## Unlikely
### Bruma (Rejected)
~~Bruma is an enormous new land mod that has been met with almost universal acclaim. I acknowledge, it is an excellent mod, but it may be too big of an ask for it to be included.~~ Bruma will not be in LS2.

## Not Changing
### Master of Disguise (complete, pending revision)
I feel the need to address this mod specifically. It's been a headache for me dealing with questions about the mod almost constantly, but Master of Disguise is basically the only thing that does what it does. Master of Disguise will be sticking around.

### Sustained Magic (complete, pending revision)
This is another mod that I've had to answer a ton of questions about, but the simple fact is this: If you haven't played using Sustained Magic, you'll never want to go back afterwards. I have hand-patched this mod to work with LS (including a few hours in CK fixing it) and it will be staying.

### UI Changes (complete, pending revision)
I am very happy with the state of the LS HUD and UI. The main menu is included in this. It will be staying. The only thing I might look into is possibly changing the UI font.

### The MCMs (complete, pending revision)
The MCMs will be automated as much as I can, but expect the amount of time you spend in these menus to increase. More mods = more MCMs. Sorry.

### Combat Gameplay Overhaul, Nemesis, and Combat in General (complete, pending revision)
I have to be 100% honest here: I don't see a point to switch to Nemesis. Yet. If Nemesis gets some features that FNIS does not have, then I'll look into it further. To this end, Combat Gameplay Overhaul will not be in LS2. Stop asking. Please. Combat I expect to stay roughly the same. I don't really want to change the combat mechanics.

I have switched from the weird mashup of Wildcat, Mortal Enemies, and Combat Evolved to just Wildcat and Ultimate Combat.

### CBBE & BodySlide (complete, pending revision)
I like CBBE and it will be staying.

### Character/NPC Visuals (complete, pending revision)
Aside from a few more options regarding scars and tattoos, I do not expect this to change. NPCs will look more or less the same as they do currently.

### Everything Else (complete, pending revision)
Everything not explicitly mentioned in this document is unlikely to change, but anything is possible. I'll be working closely with my team to discuss mods and this could change at any moment.
